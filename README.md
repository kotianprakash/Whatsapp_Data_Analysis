# WhatsApp Data Analysis
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze WhatsApp chat data to gain insights into the conversations that took place. The project started off with basic data analyses such as getting means and sums of different statistics such as average number of words per message per user, and eventually evolved into analyzing topics that were frequently discussed in the chat.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used to analyze WhatsApp chat data involves various data analysis and natural language processing techniques. Here's how it works:

The program reads in your WhatsApp chat history from a text file.

The program performs various data analyses on the chat history, such as calculating the average number of words per message per user, the most active users in the chat, and the most frequently used emojis.

The program uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to preprocess the chat messages.

The program then uses topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the topics that were frequently discussed in the chat.

The program displays various statistics and visualizations to help you understand the chat history and the topics that were discussed.

## Conclusion

WhatsApp data analysis is a useful technique for gaining insights into the conversations that took place. This project demonstrates how various data analysis and natural language processing techniques can be used to perform a comprehensive analysis of a WhatsApp chat history. With further development and refinement, this technique could be used in real-world applications such as social media monitoring and sentiment analysis.
